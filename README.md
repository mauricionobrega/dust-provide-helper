# Dust @provide helper

This helper has been inspired by [dustmotes-provide](https://github.com/rragan/dust-motes/tree/master/src/helpers/data/provide), but has been rewritten to work in more complex situations, especially with [Makara 2](http://krakenjs.com/makara).

See [here](https://github.com/krakenjs/makara/blob/v2.x/ADVANCED.md) for a detailed example with Makara.
